The columns represent the different attributes or fields of the data, while the rows represent individual records. The relationships between the tables are defined by the use of primary and foreign keys.

there are many other types of databases such as Object oriented databases used for software development, Time series databases used for analytics, and more)

(My intretation: A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table in a database. It's important because it helps to make sure that each record is different, it allows for relationships between tables, it's used to speed up searches, and it helps with updating or deleting specific records. )

GET: retrieves data (Read)
POST: submits data to create a new resource (Create)
